# Overview of .NET MAUI Scheduler (SfScheduler)

The Syncfusion .NET MAUI Scheduler(SfScheduler) has eight different types of built-in configurable view modes that provides all the common scheduling functionalities to display appointments in different views and allows users to create and manage appointments efficiently. It exposes user interface for custom working days and hours and basic operations such as viewing daily/all day/spanned appointments, date navigation, selection, and Data binding to different sources.

## Key features

 *  **Built-in Views**: The .NET MAUI Scheduler provides a wide range of built-in view modes such as Day, Week, WorkWeek, Month, TimelineDay, TimelineWeek, TimelineWorkWeek, and TimelineMonth. These view modes allow you to display appointments across different days and months.

 * **Events**: Appointments contain information on events scheduled at specific times. In addition to default appointments, the users can use their own collections to connect a business entity to an appointment by mapping their fields such as start time, end time, subject, notes, and recurrence.

 * **Recurrence Events**: Easily configure the recurring events on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis with optimized recurrence options. Also skip or change the occurrence of a recurring appointment.

 * **Appointment Mapping**: The .NET MAUI Scheduler Scheduler control supports to map any collection that implements the object interface to populate appointments.

 * **Timezone**: The display appointments can be created in various time zones in the system time zone. The appointment start and end times are also automatically adjusted and displayed based on the daylight savings time.

 * **Timeline month view**: Display appointments across the multiple days of a month on a horizontal axis where each column represents a single day.

 * **First day of the week**: Customize the first day of the week as needed. The default first day is Sunday.
 
 * **Flexible working days**: Customize the workdays in a workweek so that the remaining days will be hidden from view.

 * **Min and Max date**: MinDate and MaxDate will limit the date range available on the Scheduler and prevent navigation beyond that range.

 * **Special time regions(Blocking time intervals)**: Disable interactions and selections for specific time ranges. This is useful when you want to block user interaction during holidays or another special events and to highlight those time slots.

 * **Blackout dates**: Disable any date in view of a scheduler to make it inactive. You can easily prevent the selection of weekends by disabling them.

 * **Hide leading and trailing dates**: Hide the previous month and next month dates in the scheduler to enhance the appearance.

 * **Custom start and end hours**: Display the event scheduler timeslot views with specific time durations by hiding the unwanted hours.
