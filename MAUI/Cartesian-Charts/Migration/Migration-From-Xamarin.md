# Migrate from Xamarin.Forms

This section explains major key features of .NET MAUI platform. 

* MAUI is essentially the next evolution of Xamarin.Forms. It is a framework that will allow us to create native user interfaces for desktop and mobile devices, and the most surprising thing about this is that it has a single code base and a single project.

* NET MAUI will support MVU (model-view-update) too and this pattern provides a unified way to build cross-platform native front ends from a single code base.

* Complete hot reload support will be provided for .NET MAUI.
