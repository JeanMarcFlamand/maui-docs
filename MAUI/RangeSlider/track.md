# Track in .NET MAUI Range Slider (SfRangeSlider)

This section helps to learn about how to customize the track in the range slider.

## Track color

You can change the active and inactive track color of the range slider using the `ActiveColor` and `InactiveColor` properties of the `TrackStyle` class.

The active side of the range slider is between start and end thumbs.

The inactive side of the range slider is between the `Minimum` value and the left thumb, and the right thumb and the `Maximum` value.

## Track height

You can change the active and inactive track height of the range slider using the `ActiveSize` and `InactiveSize` properties of the `TrackStyle` class. The default value of the `ActiveSize` and the `InactiveSize` properties are `8.0` and `6.0` respectively.
